# Fully Differential Amplifier with Gain Boosting

![Block Diagram](./Block_Diagram.png)

This project implements a high-performance fully differential amplifier using a folded cascode topology with gain boosting. The design was developed in BiCMOS8HP and optimized for gain, bandwidth, stability, and noise performance.

## âœ… Key Results

| Metric                | Achieved         |
|-----------------------|------------------|
| Gain                 | 95.8 dB          |
| GBW (Gain-Bandwidth) | 108.1 MHz        |
| Phase Margin         | 88Â°              |
| Slew Rate            | 70 V/Î¼s          |
| Dynamic Range        | 80.05 dB         |
| Settling Time        | 41 ns            |
| Power Consumption    | 6.29 mW          |

## ðŸ§  Highlights

- Gain boosting improves output resistance from 110â€¯kÎ© to 20â€¯MÎ©  
- Excellent common-mode rejection (CMRR â‰ˆ 250â€¯dB)  
- Clean transient and step response  
- Careful layout and feedback design for noise reduction
