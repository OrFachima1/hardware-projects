# 4-Bit ALU Design â€“ VLSI Final Project
![ALU Block Diagram](./Block_Diagram.png)

This project presents a complete design of a 4-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), implemented in Cadence Virtuoso using the gsclib045 standard cell library.

The ALU performs arithmetic operations (ADD, SUB) using a tree-based adder architecture, and includes hierarchical schematic design, layout of the adder, and full DRC/LVS verification.
